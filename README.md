# ELK SOC Automation - 30 Days SOC Challenge
 ELK Stack SOC automation using Fleet and OS Ticketing Server

## Day ONE: Logical Diagram

🚀 Embarking on MYDFIR 30-Days SOC Challenge! by my mentor Steven ([link](https://lnkd.in/dRGfScbr)) 🚀  
I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be diving into an intensive Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation, where I'll be provisioning and managing a complex environment on VULTR Cloud. This project is designed to enhance my skills as a SOC Analyst by replicating real-world scenarios and challenges.

### Key Components of the Environment:
- 🖥️ **Windows Server with RDP enabled**: A critical asset in many infrastructures, ripe for security monitoring and attack vector simulation.
- 🎛️ **Fleet Server**: Centralizing management and monitoring of the environment, a key part of maintaining security posture.
- 🐧 **Ubuntu Server with SSH enabled**: Providing a platform to simulate and detect unauthorized access attempts.
- 📊 **ELK Stack Server**: A powerful tool for log aggregation, analysis, and visualization—essential for incident detection and response.
- 📋 **OS Ticketing Server**: Integrating with incident response processes to track and manage security incidents efficiently.
- 🎯 **Command and Control Server with Kali Linux**: The heart of the simulated attack, representing a persistent threat actor within the network.

What to Expect:  
Over the next 30 days, I’ll be sharing insights, challenges, and key learnings as I simulate attacks and respond to incidents in this environment. This journey promises to be both rigorous and rewarding, offering valuable lessons that I look forward to applying in real-world SOC operations.
